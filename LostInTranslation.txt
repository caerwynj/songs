Lost in Translation

write a song using the following words as mood for the song: talk amongst yourselves, carry me along, all over the world, trying to hard, capture you, ignore the red jet.


Verse 2:
Lost in translation, I search for the signs
Of your love and affection, in every place I find
Carry me along, like a feather in the wind
All over the world, let's start where love begins

Verse 1:
Talk amongst yourselves, I'll just listen in
Trying too hard, to fit in with the din
Carry me along, let me ride the wave
All over the world, I'll go where you crave

Chorus:
I'm trying to capture you, to make you mine
But you slip through my fingers, like sand and time
Ignore the red jet, let's take the long way
To where our hearts can beat, and love can stay

Bridge:
We'll sail across the oceans, climb every mountain high
Explore the world together, and never say goodbye

Outro:
Talk amongst yourselves, but never forget
The love we share is stronger, than any regret.
