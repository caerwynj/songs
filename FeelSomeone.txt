You make me feel like someone
Capo 1st fret

You make me feel like I'm someone
With you, I know I can be someone
Through every high and every low
I know I've found a home, with you

You always listen when I need to talk
Support me even when I can't walk
Through every high and every low
You are the one I can always go

It's like the world has turned around
I'm suddenly standing on solid ground
Through every high and every low
Anything is possible, with you

I used to feel so lost and alone
But now I've found a home, with you
Through every high and every low
Every day I wake up to you

You make me feel like I'm someone
With you, I know I can be strong
I used to feel so lost and alone
But now I've found a home, with you
