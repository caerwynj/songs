Capo fret 4th.

Verse 1:
Em     D/F# G         C9
I'm walking down this lonely trail
Am7                C9
Trying hard to forget the hurt and the fail
The border that I crossed, left behind
A memory that's still fresh in my mind

Chorus:
G   G6      C9           D
My heart is swollen with pain and regret
I know that I must deliver, I can't forget
The dreams that I have, the path that I take
I'll keep moving forward, no matter what's at stake

Verse 2:
The road ahead is long and steep
But I know that I must take the leap
I'll leave behind the hurt and the pain
And follow the light that will lead me to gain

Chorus:
My heart is swollen with pain and regret
But I know that I must deliver, I can't forget
The dreams that I have, the path that I take
I'll keep moving forward, no matter what's at stake

Bridge:
I'll keep on walking, one step at a time
I'll follow my heart, and let my spirit shine
I'll take the lessons I've learned along the way
And build a better tomorrow, starting today

Chorus:
My heart is swollen with pain and regret
But I know that I must deliver, I can't forget
The dreams that I have, the path that I take
I'll keep moving forward, no matter what's at stake

Outro:
So I'll keep on walking, down this lonely trail
And leave behind the hurt and the fail
I'll cross every border, and deliver my heart
And let my spirit shine, and make a brand new start.
