It can get better

Verse 1:
I had a change of heart, didn't see it coming
Thought I had it all figured out, but now I'm running
Towards a different path, with an open mind
Curiosity doesn't lie, it's the truth I find

Chorus:
G                        D
It can get better, if we just believe
C9                           Cm
Anything is possible, if we don't deceive
Ourselves or each other, we can make a start
Anytime now, we can follow our heart

Verse 2:
I used to think, that life was set in stone
But now I know, we create our own tone
With every step we take, a new world unfolds
Curiosity is the key, to breaking the molds

Chorus:
It can get better, if we just believe
Anything is possible, if we don't deceive
Ourselves or each other, we can make a start
Anytime now, we can follow our heart

Bridge:
Don't be afraid, to try something new
Life is a journey, we're not yet through
With every change, comes a chance to grow
Curiosity leads the way, don't you know?

Chorus:
It can get better, if we just believe
Anything is possible, if we don't deceive
Ourselves or each other, we can make a start
Anytime now, we can follow our heart

Outro:
A change of heart, can bring us so far
Curiosity never lies, it's who we are
It can get better, anytime now
Let's follow our hearts, and take a bow.
