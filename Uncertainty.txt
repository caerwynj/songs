Capo 3rd fret.

E*: 024000

Verse 1:
Bm          Am        E*
Uncertainty clouds my mind
Bm               Am         E*
Heartbreak takes over and I find
       Bm        Am     E
Myself wandering in the dark
        Bm           Am      E
Wishing for a ray of hope to spark

Chorus:
Bm          D        A      Em
But I won't let this pain define me
     Bm                  D       A       Em
I'll rise above and I'll finally see
    Bm          D         A     Em
The spring that awaits me ahead
         Bm       D            A      Em
With new love and happiness to spread

Verse 2:
  Bm                Am  E
I know I'll find my way again
         Bm            Am         E
And I'll start to feel whole once again
                 Bm           Am
I'll pick up the pieces of my heart
            E                                      
And start a brand new chapter with a brand new 
Bm   Am   E
start

Chorus:
Because I won't let this pain define me
I'll rise above and I'll finally see
The spring that awaits me ahead
With new love and happiness to spread

Bridge:
This heartbreak will be just a memory
And I'll find my way back to serenity
I'll rise higher and be stronger than before
And I'll walk towards a brighter future, more and more

Chorus:
And I won't let this pain define me
I'll rise above and I'll finally see
The spring that awaits me ahead
With new love and happiness to spread

Outro:
I'll leave behind this heartache and pain
And I'll start a life that's not in vain
I'll rise and face the new day with grace
And bloom like a flower in spring, in this brand new place.
