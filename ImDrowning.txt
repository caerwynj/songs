I'm Drowning

Verse 1:
A    C     G     Bb
I'm drowning in my own despair
The weight of the world's too much to bear
I'm stuck in this endless pain
Nothing can break this dark, endless chain

Chorus:
edc#cbd
A                 C     Fdim   G#dim
I'm sinking down, down, down
I'm sinking, I can't be found, found, found.

Into the abyss, I can't be found
My mind is a prison, I can't break free
This life is nothing but misery

Verse 2:
The walls are closing in on me
I'm fixated on what I can't be
The world around me's turning grey
Everything I touch just fades away

Chorus:
I'm sinking down, down, down
Into the abyss, I can't be found
My mind is a prison, I can't break free
This life is nothing but misery

Bridge:
I'm searching for a way out of this hole
But every step I take just takes a toll
The darkness consumes me more every day
I can't find a way to escape this pain

Chorus:
I'm sinking down, down, down
Into the abyss, I can't be found
My mind is a prison, I can't break free
This life is nothing but misery

Outro:
I'm lost in this endless night
No way to escape this eternal fight
The world around me just fades away
And I'm left alone in the depths of decay.
