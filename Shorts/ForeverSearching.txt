Forever

E* 074050

Verse 1:
E                Asus2
Always searching for a way
E                      Asus2
To find a port in the fray
A station in the storm
A shelter to be warm

Chorus:
C                  D
Forever searching for the truth
       E*           D
In the beauty of my youth
I'll find my way, I'll find my place
       E*           D
In the beauty of my youth

Verse 2:
Down the corridor of my life
In the hallway of my strife
I search for something more
Somewhere else, somewhere sure

E                Asus2
In the crosshairs of my mind
A target that's so hard to find
But I'm sure that I'll get there
And I'll make it beautiful, I swear

Verse 3:

Repeat Chorus
