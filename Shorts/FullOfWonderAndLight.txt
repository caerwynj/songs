Night is black
Capo 3rd fret

(Verse 1)
D                                 Am7
The night is black and the sky is clear
C                                         D
Stars twinkle bright, there's nothing to fear
A gentle breeze blows through my hair
And I feel alive, without a care
(Chorus)
The world is full of wonder and light
Every step I take, feels like flight
No need to pretend, I'm free as a bird
All my worries, they have blurred
(Verse 2)
The world is filled with beauty and grace
Every moment, a smile on my face
A simple flower, a work of art
My heart beats with a rhythm, like a start
(Chorus)
(Bridge)
There's no need to rush or race
Time slows down, at a peaceful pace
I'll take my time, enjoy the view
The world's a gift, for me and you
(Chorus)
(Outro)
I'll keep this feeling, close to my heart
A reminder that life, can be a work of art
The night is black and the sky is clear
And I'll embrace it, without any fear.
