Cybernetic Beat

Verse 1:
Em
    In the night city, sky like static
Am
    I'm plugged in, on my cyberdeck
Em
   Nano circuits, micro chips
Am
   Tele-sensors, at my fingertips
Em
    In this world of robotics and control
Am
     Simstim dreams, take their toll
        C                     D
But the song plays on, and we dance

Through the nano wires, we take a chance

Em  C   D Em
We take a chance

Chorus: (Eyes in their gables see)
Em
The machines hum, all around
C
A symphony of tech, profound
A               
The sensor's pulse, in every beat
C
As we move, to the cybernetic beat

Verse 2:
And in this wired world, we find a way
To move through life, night and day
With technology as our guide
We dance through life, side by side

In this world of robotics and control
Simstim dreams, take their toll
But the song plays on, and we dance
Through the nano wires, we take a chance


Chorus:
Em
The machines hum, all around
C
A symphony of tech, profound
A               
The sensor's pulse, in every beat
C
As we move, to the cybernetic beat

Bridge:
So let's dance, to the rhythm of the night
With sensors and tech, our guiding light
In this world of control and cybernetic sound
We find a way to dance, as we move around.

Verse:
In this world of robotics and control
Simstim dreams, take their toll
But the gavotte plays on, and we dance
Through the nano wires, we take a chance
