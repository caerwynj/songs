Borderlands

Intro: D Bm A D
VERSE
D                  G
The sun beats down on the sand
As we march out through this barren land
CHORUS
D               Bm         Bm Bm
Out here on the borderlands
      A                 D             D D
Where life is tough and hard to stand
VERSE
Our dreams are just beyond the reach
But still, we press on, hoping to breach
CHORUS
VERSE
D                            G
But still we hold on to our will to live
With every ounce of strength we can give
CHORUS
We face the challenges that come our way
And we never give up, no matter the day
CHORUS
VERSE
Where the winds of fate are cruel
And the future is a constant duel
CHORUS
Bridge:
G                   D
We've been through fire, 
G                   D
we've been through pain
G                Bm            A
But we refuse to let it be in vain

Outro:
Out here on the borderlands
We'll keep on going, hand in hand
