Wichita Winds

Capo 1st fret
Verse 1:
Wichita winds, they howl and moan
Lost in this world, I'm not free

Wichita winds, they howl and moan
A cry that echoes in my bones
I'm crying out loud, 
I'm crying out loud, 

Chorus:
can't you hear me?
can't you hear me?

Verse 2:
I'm wandering winds, lost and alone
I need someone to set me free

My heart is heavy, my spirit unknown
A cry that echoes in my bones
I'm crying out loud, 
I'm crying out loud, 

Chorus:
can't you see me?
can't you see me?


Verse 3:
Forget me not, in this shallow grave
I'm still alive, but I can't be saved

I'm reaching out, for someone to hold
In this darkness, my soul is so cold

Chorus:
can't you reach me?
can't you touch me?


Verse 4:
Wichita winds, they howl and moan
Lost in this world, I'm not free
