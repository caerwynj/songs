C9             G        Em      D9
  Everything's changing all the time
              C
Let's slow it down


The world is spinning fast around
Trying to keep up 


Chorus:
G    Em      D9
slow down time
           Am     Em   
breathe it in
           C        D9
breathe it in

Changing the time, 
it's hard to keep up 
it's hard to keep up 


             G        Em      D9
Everything's changing all the time
             C
Let's slow it down


The world can wait for just a while
And feel the moment 

CHORUS

I feel like time is slipping away
And I can't keep up


Take a break and clear my mind
Feel the moment, 


CHORUS



Outro
Let my worries go, let the peace begin
