Verse: 9/8
D             C9      D
Nostalgia, it hits me hard
Memories of a love now scarred
G/B                C9
Broken dreams and shattered glass
D9
A love that couldn't last

Broken, but I'll survive
Through the darkness, I'll thrive
The pain of losing you
A pain that still feels new

Chorus: 4/4
Em                G
Broken dreams and shattered glass
D9
A love that couldn't last
The pain of losing you
A pain that still feels new

Verse: 9/8
I still feel your touch at night
it's just a memory that ignites
I'll take these scars and learn to grow
I won't let them bring me low

The past can be a heavy weight
But I won't let it seal my fate
And though I may be scarred
I'll keep moving ever far.

Chorus:
Broken dreams and shattered glass
A love that couldn't last
The pain of losing you
A pain that still feels new

Chorus:
I'll take these scars and learn to grow
I won't let them bring me low
And though I may be scarred
I'll keep moving never far.

Outro: (chorus cords)
it's always there
it's more than I can bear
