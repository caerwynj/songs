It's Out There

Verse 1:
I've been searching for a long, long time
Looking for something I can't define
I've been wandering, lost in the night
Hoping that somehow, I'll see the light

Chorus:
But I know, deep down inside
There's a reason to keep getting high
It's out there, waiting for me
An emergent multiverse

Verse 2:
I've stumbled and I've fallen down
Lost my way in this crazy town
But I won't give up, I'll keep on going
I'll keep looking for the signs that keep showing

Chorus:
But I know, deep down inside
There's a reason to keep trying
It's out there, waiting for me
An emergent reality

Bridge:
The road may be long, the path unclear
But I know I'm getting nearer
To the place where I belong
To the place where my heart is strong

Chorus:
But I know, deep down inside
There's a reason to keep trying
It's out there, waiting for me
An emergent reality

Outro:
So I'll take another try, I'll keep on going
I won't stop until I find what I'm looking for
It's out there, waiting for me
An emergent reality.
