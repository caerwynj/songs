Spring song
Drop D tuning; Capo 3rd fret.

(Verse 1)
D                         Em9/D
The cold weather's got me down
But I've got a goal to chase
A9                              D
And though the winter seems to drown
My spirits in this place

(Chorus)
The coming spring is on its way
It won't be long 'til we can play
Outside where we are meant to be
And somehow it will be alright, you'll see

(Verse 2)
The wind is howling at my door
But I won't let it keep me in
I'll keep moving, I'll explore
And let the outside in

(Chorus)
But the coming spring is on its way
And it won't be long 'til we can play
Outside where we are meant to be
And somehow it will be alright, you'll see

(Bridge)
The snow may be deep and the roads may be icy
But I'll keep my head up, I'll stay feisty
I know that brighter days are ahead
And I won't let the cold get in my head

(Outro)
We'll feel the warmth of the sun on our skin
And let the cool breeze blow in
We'll be together, happy and free
And somehow it will be alright, just wait and see.

(Chorus)
But the coming spring is on its way
And it won't be long 'til we can play
Outside where we are meant to be
And somehow it will be alright, you'll see
