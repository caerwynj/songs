Verse 2:
The game of masks, we play 

Cmaj7 C                          Em
Hiding our true selves, under a spell

We're all searching for
    Em   
a deliverance
a deliverance

Instrumental:


Verse 3:
in this game of masks, we're all lost

Hiding our fears, at any cost
But we're searching for 
A deliverance 

from this doubt

Bridge:
But maybe it's time to let them fall
To show our true selves
Embrace our flaws
break these laws

And find a way
find a way

Outro:
We'll find our way out of this game
Embrace our true selves, it's not too late
We'll find our deliverance, a way to be free
And we'll no longer hide, we'll just be.
