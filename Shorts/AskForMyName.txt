Ask for my name
Capo 1st fret.

Verse 1:
A               F
Touch my heart, feel the beat
D             D
Hear my song, let it speak
Listen to my music, let it take you away
Feel something inside, let it stay

Chorus:
A                       C
Ask for my name, I'll be there
F                          D
Call out a question, I'll answer with care
I'm here to share my soul with you
Through my music, I'll make it true

Verse 2:
Every note, every chord
Comes from within, where I store
All my thoughts, my hopes, my dreams
In my music, it all streams

Chorus:
Ask for my name, I'll be there
Call out a question, I'll answer with care
I'm here to share my soul with you
Through my music, I'll make it true

Bridge:
My music is my way to express
All the emotions that I suppress
So listen closely, hear me out
And together, we'll scream and shout

Chorus:
Ask for my name, I'll be there
Call out a question, I'll answer with care
I'm here to share my soul with you
Through my music, I'll make it true

Outro:
So come on and touch my heart
Let my music be your start
Listen closely, feel the beat
And let our souls finally meet.
