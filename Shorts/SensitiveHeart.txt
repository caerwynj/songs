Sensitive Heart
ChatGPT, Caerwyn Jones 2023-02



Verse 1:
Am        Em          Am       Em
Sensitive soul, can't help but feel
Am               Em             Am      Em
Strong enough to deal with this ordeal
Am        Em    Am          Em
Mind is racing, feelings collide
Am     Em             Am    Em
Lonely nights, I just wanna hide

Chorus:bcddb bcde
Cmaj7             G  C               G
Gotta keep moving,   gotta be strong
Nothing makes sense, but I'll carry on
Nonsense words, jibberish too
Nonsense all around, but I'll pull through

Verse 2:
Sensitive heart, always on edge
Strong enough to get out of this head
Memories haunt, I'm lost in thought
Lonely roads, where have I sought

Chorus:
C             G              
Gotta keep moving, gotta be strong
Nothing makes sense, but I'll carry on
Nonsense words, jibberish too
Nonsense all around, but I'll pull through

Bridge:
     Am7                  C9      G
In a world of chaos, I'll find my way
With a heart so sensitive, but strong each day
Nonsense may surround, but I'll be okay
With a mind so full, I'll find my way

Chorus:
Cmaj7         G              
Gotta keep moving, gotta be strong
Nothing makes sense, but I'll carry on
Cmaj7    G          Cmaj7     G
Nonsense words, and jibberish too
Nonsense all around, but I'll pull through

Outro:
Cmaj7     G          Cmaj7   G
Sensitive heart, now shining bright
Cmaj7            G        Cmaj7
Strong enough to face the light.
Mind is clear, no longer afraid
Lonely nights, no longer in shades
