Turn back time

Capo 2nd fret

Verse 1:
Bm              Bm/A              G     D/F#
    I know that I can't turn back time,
      E7             D/F#          G
But I still dream of when you were mine,
Maybe someday I'll find my way,
Back to where we started, and we'll stay.

Pre-chorus
Em  D/F#    G
You know it's you

that I wanna
Chorus
Bm     A     E
Roll back time    I wanna
Roll back time


Verse 2:
In the city where the ocean meets the shore,
I'm standing here with pain I can't ignore,
I'm trying to find a way to touch you again,
To feel like I belong where we began.



Verse 3:
The city lights and the ocean waves,
They used to be the only things I craved,
But now I'm lost in this urban maze,
Trying to find my way out of this daze.


Outro:
In the city where the ocean meets the shore,
I'm just a weirdo trying to find the door,
To a place where I belong with you,
And all my pain will be forever through.
