If we keep on moving, if we keep on moving

Life can be difficult, it's hard to survive

In this world we're constantly searching to find
Our place in the world, exploring with play
But sometimes our mistakes can lead the way


[CHORUS]
Throw away the doubts
Finding our way 
Our journey in life
Finding our way


[OUTRO]
Every mistake, we turn into a treasure
But we keep on moving, we keep on moving

we'll keep on moving
never hiding
if we keep on moving
Even when life sends us ...
