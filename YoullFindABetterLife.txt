You'll find a better life

To the chords of Man in the mirror.

Verse 1:
I know we've been through rough times
And we've tried to make things right
But lately it feels like we're lost
In a never-ending fight

Pre-Chorus:
And I can see it in your eyes
You're tired of all the lies
You're looking for a way out
And I won't hold you back now

Chorus:
You'll find a better life without me
I won't try to make you stay
Just know that I'll always love you
Even if we're worlds apart someday

Verse 2:
I know I've made mistakes before
And I can't change what's in the past
But I promise to let you go
And to make this moment last

Pre-Chorus:
And I can see it in your smile
You've been waiting for a while
To break free from my embrace
And to start a brand new phase

Chorus:
You'll find a better life without me
I won't try to make you stay
Just know that I'll always love you
Even if we're worlds apart someday

Bridge:
I'll cherish every memory
And I'll keep them close to heart
But I won't hold you back anymore
It's time for us to part

Chorus:
You'll find a better life without me
I won't try to make you stay
Just know that I'll always love you
Even if we're worlds apart someday

Outro:
So go ahead and spread your wings
And fly towards the light
I'll be cheering for you always
As you soar towards a better life.
