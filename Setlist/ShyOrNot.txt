Shy or not

Capo 2nd fret

Verse 1:
(f#,a,b)
Bm                 A 
In this mood, I'm feeling blue,
E                   E
But with music, I'm close to you,
Bm                  A
Even though you're far away,
E                  E
In my eyes, you're here to stay.

Chorus:
(c#,b,d)
Bm               A
Shy or not, I'll sing it true,
E
Without you, I don't know what I'd do.
Bm               A
Shy or not, I'll sing it true,
Without you, I don't know what I'd do.
Tell all the stars, of our love tonight,

Verse 2:
After all this time we've spent,
Shall I be bold, or remain content,
Who can tell, what the future holds,
But with you, my heart is whole.

Chorus:


Shy or not, I'll sing it true,
Without you, I don't know what I'd do.
Shy or not, I'll sing it true,
Without you, I don't know what I'd do.
Tell all the stars, of our love tonight,


Bridge:
With every note, I'll hold you near,
And with every chord, I'll wipe away your tears,
Together we'll dance, under the starry sky,
And with each other, we'll never say goodbye.

Chorus:
Orbiting around Orion's light,
Tell all the stars, of our love tonight,
Shy or not, I'll sing it true,
Without you, I don't know what I'd do.

Outro:
In this mood, I'm feeling free,
With music, you're here with me,
Orbiting around Orion's light,
Together we'll make everything right.
