Call my name  bpm 77 Jazz1, 41 Match CLean
capo 1st fret   6/8

Verse 1:
(c)
C9          C9        D/F#
Slow my heart down, make it calm
Bm7                       Em
Turn  my face from  the storm
C9                 D/F#
Paint my lies with pretty words
   Cmaj7                    D
So they'll remain unseen by you

Chorus:
C9 
Call my name
               Am7
And everything falls apart
        C
I can't hide from the pain
            D
Of a broken heart
C9 
Call my name
               Am7
And everything falls apart
        C
You can't hide from the pain
            D
Of a broken heart

Verse 2:
  C         C      D/F#
I thought I had it all figured out
    Bm                  Em
But now I'm filled with doubt
C9               D/F#
Can't escape the truth of my mistakes
      Cmaj7                     D
Can't pretend they were unlucky breaks

Chorus:

Outro:
C                           D/F#
Slow my heart down, make it calm
Bm7                            Em
Shape my face I'm not strong
C                          D/F#
Paint my lies with pretty words
C                            D
But I know they'll always be heard.


Repeat chorus to fade.





Bridge:
Am7
I know I let you down
C
And I wish I could take it back
Am7
But all I can do is face the music
C                            D
And hope we can get back on track

Chorus:
