Rain on me

Capo 3rd fret

Verse 1:
           Em,           D
Hell is on earth, it's a place I know too well,
            Em               D
lonely confinement is my personal hell,
           C                     A
But in the darkness, I hear you calling out my name,

           Em       D
Through the pain, I hold on to you.
      Em                D
Cruel love, it's like a torture to me,
               C                          A
But I can't forget about you,  I hear you calling out my name

Chorus:
[G   D   Em]
Rain on me, let the tears fall down,
[G   D   Em]
Rain on me, falling on lovers,
[G   D   Em]
Rain on me, hoping to be found.

Verse 2:
     Em            D
I am trapped, in a love that's so wrong,
       Em            D
in the depths, I can still cling on,
            C                  A
I hear your voice, it's like a sweet melody,

        Em              D
But the truth is, I'm a soul in agony.
      Em                D
Cruel love, it's like a torture to me,
             C                           A
But in the darkness, I hear you calling out my name

Chorus:
[G   D   Em]
Rain on me, let the tears fall down,
[G   D   Em]
Rain on me, falling on lovers,
[G   D   Em]
Rain on me, hoping to be found.

===================


Bridge:
We're lost in this cycle of love and pain,
But we keep going back, again and again,
Our hearts are broken, shattered into a million pieces,
But we keep searching for love, hoping it releases.

Chorus:
Cruel love, it's like a terrible torture,
But I can't forget about you,
Rain on me, let the tears fall down,
Calling lovers, hoping to be found.

Outro:
I'll keep searching for you, until the end of time,
Hoping that one day, you'll be mine,
Until then, I'll keep calling lovers, in the pouring rain,
Hoping that one of them will take away the pain.
