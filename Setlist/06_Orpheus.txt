Song of Fantasy Divide.
Capo 2nd fret

Verse 1:
D                A
Orpheus may have lost his way
    Bm                    G
But we can still find our light today
    D                     A
The wind may howl and the gap may stay
    Bm                     G
But we'll on keep playing, come what may.

Chorus:
D                     Asus4
How can we bridge the divide
        Bm7               Asus4
Between what we dream and what we find
       D                 Asus4                     
With a little love and a little grace
       Bm7               Asus4
We can find our way to a better place

Verse 2:
D                     A
Life can be a game we play
        Bm                  G
But the rules keep changing every day
   D                        A  
We can't control the wind's sway
            Bm          G
But we can still find a way

Chorus
Bridge:
G            F#m            Em      A
Sometimes we stumble and we fall
G                 F#m   Em    A
But we can always rise above it all

Outro:
D                  A
Orpheus played his lyre,
Bm            G
Tricks up his sleeve,
D
But the wind would howl
A
And his music would leave
Bm
The gap between fantasy
G
And reality 

D   Asus4  Bm7   G
too wide to believe

a gap too wide to believe
a gap too wide
