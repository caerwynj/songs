weirdo zero

Capo 1st fret



Chorus:
               C         G/B          Am7
But I'm just a weirdo, a zero in this place,
               C                 G/B      Am7
Feeling like I don't fit in with total disgrace,
C                 G                    Am7
Wishing for everything to be just like before,
But it's Friday night and I'm still feeling unsure.


Chorus:
But I'm just a weirdo, a zero in this place,
Feeling like I don't fit in with total disgrace,
Wishing for everything to be just like before,
But it's Friday night and I'm still feeling unsure.


Chorus:
But I'm just a weirdo, a zero in this place,
Feeling like I don't fit in with  disgrace,
Wishing for everything to be  like before,
But it's Friday night and I'm still feeling unsure.
