Sometimes I Feel Like I'm Losing
PLUCKED
Verse 1:
G       G       Am7  Am7      C9    C9
    Sometimes I feel like I'm losing
G       Am7                   C9
    Myself in this crazy game
G            Am7           C9
 B ut then I hear a quirky sound
        G           Am7     C9
That reminds me I'm not the same

Pre-Chorus:
G           Em9      Bm7        C9
Through the fog and through the haze
G           Em9      Bm7      C9
I see a light that shines so bright
G
It's brilliant and it's bold
And it guides me through the night

Chorus:
D             C9      G
  So come and take my hand
Let's dance through this crazy land
Together we'll make our stand
In a world hard-edged and grand

Verse 2:
The world can be a tough place
We don't have to face it alone
We'll be quirky, we'll be brilliant
And we'll make this world our own


Pre-Chorus:
Through the fog and through the haze
I see a light that shines so bright
It's brilliant and it's bold
And it guides me through the night

Chorus:
So come and take my hand
Let's dance through this crazy land
Together we'll make our stand
In a world hard-edged and grand

Bridge:
In the hard-edged world we live in
Things can get a little bit bizarre
But I found a quirky little place
Where I can be who I truly are

Chorus:
So come and take my hand
Let's dance through this crazy land
Together we'll make our stand
In a world that's hard-edged and grand

Outro:
In this world of fog and haze
We'll shine like stars, brilliant and brave
And we'll make our mark on this crazy place
In a way that's quirky and full of grace.
