Positive Monster  69bpm
Capo 2nd fret
Verse 1:
E9                              C9
The sight of you, it tears me apart,
            Am7                  B7
A positive monster, who broke my heart,
I'm a full time escapist, trying to run,
From the pain that you've caused, 

Chorus:
what have you done?
what have you done?
Ahhh, what have you done?

Verse 2:
The river flows, it never stops,
Just like my tears, they never drop,
The leaves will fall, the seasons change,
But my hurt remains, 

Chorus
Bridge:
You said you loved me, it felt so real,
But now I'm broken, with no time to heal,
I thought you were forever and more,
But now I'm just a stranger, knocking at your door.

CHORUS (higher register)

Outro:
The river flows on, the leaves decay,
The sky is grey, but I'll find my way,
I'll move on from you, I'll be just fine,
And someday, you won't define me.
