Let go of what I can't control
Capo 2nd fret

Verse 1:
G
I'm feeling the grip of the past
G
Attached to memories that won't last
C9
Stuck in a cycle of pain
C9
Fixated on the things I can't change

Chorus:
G          D/F#   Em           D
But I know I need to loosen my hold
C
Let go of what I can't control
C
Let go of what I can't control

Verse 2:
I've been holding on for too long
With a broken wing, I can't fly strong
But I know that I need to spread my wings
And fly towards the joy that life can bring

Chorus:

Instrumental (to verse melody)

Verse:
It's not easy to break the chains of the past
But I know I can do it, I'll make it last
I'll find the courage to let go
And embrace a future that's bright and bold

Chorus:
It's time to break free from this old routine
And start living a life that's serene

Outro (to chorus chords):
I'm letting go of the grip of the past
No longer attached to things that don't last
I'm breaking free from the cycle of pain
And embracing a life that's full of gain.
