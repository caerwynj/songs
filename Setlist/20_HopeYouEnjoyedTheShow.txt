Verse 1:
D
I'm standing here, alone in the spotlight
Asus2
Playing my guitar, singing my heart out
I'm a solo act, but it works for me
No distractions, just my music and me

Chorus:
D
Without a doubt, I give it my all
Asus2                               C9,    G
For all of you, who come to hear me play
D
But behind the wall, I'm still just me
Asus2                      C9     G
And I hope you'll wait for me

Verse 2:
It's complicated, this life I lead
Traveling from town to town, chasing my dreams
Sometimes I wonder, if it's all worth it
But then I see your faces, and I know I can't quit

Chorus:
Without a doubt, I give it my all
For all of you, who come to hear me play
But behind the wall, I'm still just me
And I hope you'll wait for me

Bridge:
Sometimes I feel like giving up
But then I remember, the love in your eyes
And I know that I can't let you down
So I'll keep playing, until the day I die

Chorus:
Without a doubt, I give it my all
For all of you, who come to hear me play
But behind the wall, I'm still just me
And I hope you'll wait for me
