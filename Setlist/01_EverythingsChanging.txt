C9             G        Em      D9
  Everything's changing all the time
              C
Let's slow it down


The world is spinning fast around
Trying to keep up 


Chorus:
G    Em      D9
slow down time
           Am     Em   
breathe it in
           C        D9
breathe it in

Changing the time, 
it's hard to keep up 
it's hard to keep up

The world can wait for just a while
And feel the moment

Verse 3:
I feel like time is slipping away
            Am7
And I can't keep up

Take a break and clear my mind
          Am7
Feel the moment, 

CHORUS
