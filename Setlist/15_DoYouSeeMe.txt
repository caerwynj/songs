Verse 1:
b b b b, b  g# f#
E                           Bm
Caught in the cold, feeling numb
  A                          E
Indifference creeps in, I'm feeling glum
E                         Bm
Shallow feelings, nothing seems to ignite
I'm awake but everything feels so trite

Chorus: (f# e)
E                                  A
Do you see me when you close your eyes?
E                                 A
Do you hear me when you dream at night?
          C#m7             A6
I long to feel your touch again
F#m(9)                               E
To have you here with me until the end

Verse 2:
Looking for warmth in a world so cold
Feeling like I'm young, yet I'm so old
Trapped in a place where feelings are a game
But I'm awake now and won't play that way again

Chorus.

Bridge:
F#m                          A
I'll find my way out of this lonely place
F#m                        A
Won't let the indifference leave a trace

Chorus.

END




I'll break free from these shallow feelings
And find a new path, with deeper meanings
