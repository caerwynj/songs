Choose to live

Verse 1:
Em  (e d c# c)
(b)     ^                          (d)
You can see the difference in your eyes
                          A     Am
And it's hard to hide the pain inside
               Em               ^
Hiding in your room, hoping to escape 
                   A        Am
The sadness always seems to overtake

Pre-Chorus:
Em                         Em+C#
You feel like you're dying inside
                           C
Trying to hold on for life
                              Em
But the weight is too much to bear
         A             Em
And it's hard to even care

Chorus:
    C       D          Em
But please, choose to live
                       A
But please, choose to live

Verse 2:
The world can be cruel and dark
And it's hard to find a spark
To keep you going day by day
When everything feels like it's slipping away

Chorus:

Verse 3:
you don't believe that things can get better
when the storm seems to last forever
It's okay to feel the pain
But don't let it keep you in chains


Chorus:
