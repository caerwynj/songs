I Never Say
Verse 1:
Gmaj7               Am7
I've never been good with words,
C9
Especially when it comes to you.
I try to tell you how I feel,
But the right words never come through.

Chorus:
Am7                 C9
I never say you're beautiful,
C9                             Bm
But that doesn't mean it's not true.
Am7                    C9
You're the light in my life,
          Bbmaj7    Fmaj7  Gmaj7       
And I'm so lucky to have   you.

Verse 2:
I see the way you light up a room,
With your smile and your grace.
I feel like the luckiest man,
Every time I see your face.
CHORUS

Bridge:
Fmaj7                 Gmaj7
I know I don't say it enough,
Fmaj7                 Gmaj7
But you mean everything to me.
Fmaj7                       C9
You're my rock, my love, my life,
      Bbmaj7 Fmaj7 Gmaj7
And I hope you can see.

Chorus:
I never say you're beautiful,
But that doesn't mean it's not true.
You're the light in my life,
And I'm so lucky to have you.

Outro:
So here's my song, my love,
A tribute to you.
I hope you know how much I care,
And how much I love you.

I never say you're beautiful
But that doesn't mean it's not true.
You're the light in my life,
And I'm so lucky to have you.
