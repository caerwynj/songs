Verse 1:
G                            C9
I'm feeling so embarrassed, I should be

My head's spinning round, can't you see
I dwell on all the things I've done wrong
Pity me, I can't take it for too long

Pre-Chorus:
D                                C9
I need closure, to put it all to rest
D                                  C9
End this trial, put my mind at its best

              G     D/F#        F         C
I'm searching for a way out, to ease this pain
          G    D/F# F    C
Finding a way, to start again

Verse 2:

Need to break free, find a better day
Take me out, away from here
Where the sun shines, and the sky is clear

Chorus:

Bridge:
I won't let my mistakes define me
I'll learn from them, and set myself free
I won't dwell on what could have been
I'll focus on the future, and what I can win

Outro:
I'm finding my way, step by step
No more pity, no more regrets
I'll take control, and make it right
This is my journey, and I'll win this fight.
