Verse 1:
I've been climbing hills all day
Feelin' lost, don't know the way
But the easy weather keeps me strong
And I keep moving on and on

Chorus:
The afterlife is calling me
But I've got so much more to see

These quiet trails lead me home
I won't quit before it's too late

I keep on moving on and on and on and on.
I keep on moving on and on and on and on.


Verse 2:
The wind whispers in my ear
Telling me to have no fear
I can feel my heart beating fast
As I climb up the mountain pass

Chorus:
The afterlife is calling me
But I've got so much more to see
These quiet trails lead me home
I won't quit before it's too late to roam

Bridge:
And when I reach the top
I'll stop and take it all in
The beauty of this world
Is worth every step I've been

Chorus:
The afterlife is calling me
But I've got so much more to see
These quiet trails lead me home
I won't quit before it's too late to roam

Outro:
I'll keep on climbing, climbing high
With the easy weather by my side
I won't quit before it's too late
To see all the wonders that await.
