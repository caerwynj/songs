Strange Feeling
Feb 2023
Capo 2nd fret
Chorus:
C9	Leave me alone with the strange feeling
Am7	It's awkward but it's so revealing
G	The silence is what I am needing
D	So find the peace I am seeking
	Leave me alone, let me be
	I need to find a way to be free
	This strange feeling won't let me go
	Awkward moments, that cut the flow

Verse 1: ggb
Am  	I'm sleeping 
C   	but my mind's awake
G   	A million thoughts, 
D   	they keep me safe
	But still I feel 
	this longing ache
	For something that's 
	so hard to take
Chorus:
Verse 2:
Am7	The night is long 
C       and full of dreams
G       Some are real 
D   	and some  are schemes
	I wake up feeling 
	so extreme
	Like I'm living 
	in a different scene
Instrumental:
Chorus:
Outro:
Silent nights and lonely days
Trying to find a way to escape this haze
I'm sleeping, but my heart won't rest
Longing for a love that's at its best.

Verse:
I'm sleeping but my mind won't rest
Memories of you still manifest
I'm longing for a way to forget
But thoughts of you won't leave me yet





Verse 2:
The silence is deafening, it's all I hear
As I lay awake with my tears
I'm longing for a way to escape
This strange love that I can't shake



Bridge:
I'm lost in this love that feels so wrong
My heart aches as I try to be strong
I'm sleeping, but my dreams won't come
Longing for a love that's not so numb
