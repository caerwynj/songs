I'm Freefalling

To chords of Creep.


Verse 1:
Heart is racing, mind's in a daze
Gravity's pulling me in a craze
Feels like I'm flying, but I'm not quite sure
The wind in my hair, I'm feeling so pure

Chorus:
Freefall, freefall
Falling fast, don't know when I'll stall
Freefall, freefall
Losing control, but I'm not afraid at all

Verse 2:
I'm not sure how I got here
But I know that I have no fear
Letting go of all that weighs me down

A
i'm freefalling
Am   
i'm freefalling  (c d)

Am
I'm soaring high, I'm unbound  (g, f#, e, e, e, g#)

Chorus:
Freefall, freefall
Falling fast, don't know when I'll stall
Freefall, freefall
Losing control, but I'm not afraid at all

Bridge:
I'll never know what's waiting for me
But I won't stop, I'll just let it be
Embracing the unknown, I'll take the leap
And when I land, I'll be back on my feet

Chorus:
Freefall, freefall
Falling fast, don't know when I'll stall
Freefall, freefall
Losing control, but I'm not afraid at all

Outro:
I'm freefalling, I'm freefalling
Losing control, but I'm not afraid at all
I'm freefalling, I'm freefalling
I'll keep on falling, I'll keep on falling.
