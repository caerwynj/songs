Lightning in a bottle

VERSE 1
        A                               G
In the darkness of the night, a spark ignites,
           D/F#              Em
A flash of inspiration, blinds my eyes,
A melody that dances through the air,
I'll weave it into words, a story we'll share.

(Pre-Chorus)
Bm7
I've been searching for a way,
            E7
The perfect way to let you know,

CHORUS
                A        Asus2          Em
I've caught the light    -ning     in a bo-ttle,
           G         
Wrapped in rhythm and rhyme,
                             Bm7
Every note, every word, I've poured my heart,
     A        Asus2                 Em
This gift, my love, I'll give it to yo-u.
                G                     E7
I'll give it to you,    i'm giving it all

VERSE 2
Each verse reveals a piece of my soul,
A love that's stronger, after taken its toll,
But the beauty ,  it shines so bright,
This song's testament to our endless fight.

CHORUS

(Bridge)
And as the chorus swells, the tempo rises,
The energy bursts, lightning surprises,
I'll serenade you with this symphony,
A melody that echoes our love's harmony.

(Verse 3)
With every strum of the guitar, every beat of the drum,
I'm painting a portrait of our love, a masterpiece to become,
And when the final chord rings out strong, true,
I'll give you this song, a piece of my heart, just for you.



==============

That this song is just for you,
I'll give it all, my love so true.

(Outro)
So take this lightning in a bottle, embrace its power,
Let it light up your world, in every waking hour,
For this song is my love, my devotion so pure,
A melody for eternity, our love's allure.
