I'm Arriving
Capo 2nd fret

Verse 1:
I'm falling fast, with terminal velocity
But I know that soon, I'll be arriving safely
Through the wind and rain, I hold on tight
With each passing moment, I gain new sight

Chorus:
C             Em
I'm arriving, arriving at my destination
C                           D
Every second, I feel the anticipation
C                              Em
I'm reaching lower heights, with every breath I take
C                 D
I'm arriving, landing on drone ship
"Of course I still love you"

Verse 2:
G                        D/F#
The journey's been long, with twists and turns
Em                         C9
But I've learned to trust, and to let go and learn
I've overcome fears, and faced my doubts
And now I'm ready, to step out

Chorus:


Drone ship
"Read the instructions"
Altitude. 


Bridge:
I may have fallen, but I got up again
I faced the challenge, and I overcame the pain
And now I'm stronger, than I ever was before
I'm arriving, and I'm ready for more

Chorus:

Outro:
I'm arriving, and the world is waiting for me
I'm arriving, and I'm ready to be free
I'm arriving, and nothing can hold me back
I'm arriving, and I'm ready to attack.
