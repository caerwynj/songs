Borderland
No capo.
[kind of 12-bar blues]
Verse 1:
There's a game to be played, a fight with all ones might
A battle of life or death, to make the wrongs right 
An avenging angel, with no souls to save,
Will carry you away, with the cold embrace.

In the borderland, where the light meets the dark,
Where the rules are different, and will leave their mark
The avenging angel is the queen of hearts

Chorus:
[A] In the dark side of the city, where the shadows fall,
[A] There are players in the game, who will heed the call,
[D] The stakes are high, the price is steep,
[A] But they'll play the game, and the secrets they'll keep.

Verse 2:
[E] In the borderland, where the light meets the dark,
[D] Where the rules are different, and will leave their mark
[A] The avenging angel is the queen of hearts

[A] Will face the players, in a game of life or death.

CHORUS
Outro:
In the borderland, where the light meets the dark,
The avenging angel will make their mark,
And though the game may never end,
The players will always have a friend.
