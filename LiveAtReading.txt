Verse 1:
G                   D/F#
I close my eyes and see it all
Em              C     D
Total recall of every fall


Verse 2:
G                   D/F#
All of you, you're by my side
Em                  C     
Together we'll face the rising tide
G                   D/F#
But you were never around before
Em              C     D
And now I need you even more

Bridge:
G                   D/F#
The memories fade, the pain remains
Em              C     D
I'm reaching out, but it's in vain
G                   D/F#
The clock is ticking, the end is near
Em              C     D
But with you here, I have no fear

Chorus:
G       Am
Live at Reading
           C           D
it felt so right to be with you
G       Am
Life at Reading
My heart was pounding, I won't forget


Total recall of every night
Live at Reading, it felt so right
All of you, you're in my heart
Together, we'll never be apart.
