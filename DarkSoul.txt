Dark Soul
ChatGPT, Caerwyn Jones 2023-02


Verse 1:
I've got a skeleton, buried in my head
It's making me think of death, and wish I was dead
I've got a demon, living in my heart
It's making me do things, that tear me apart

Chorus:
Em                              D
You're a dark soul, with you're head in the grave
You're a sick mind, with you're feet in the grave
You're a twisted being, that's driving to nowhere
You're a dark soul, and I'm loving the nightmare

Verse 2:
I've got a poison, flowing through my veins
It's making me numb, and drive me insane
I've got a monster, living in my soul
It's making me scream, and lose control
 
Chorus:
You're a dark soul, with you're head in the grave
You're a sick mind, with you're feet in the grave
You're a twisted being, that's driving to nowhere
You're a dark soul, and I'm loving the nightmare

Bridge:
I don't need light, or hope or love
I just want to sink, into the dark
I'll cry and moan, and wail and despair
I'll be a dark soul, forever there

Outro:
You're a dark soul, with my head in the grave
You're a sick mind, with my feet in the grave
You're a twisted being, that's driving to nowhere
You're a dark soul, and I'm loving the nightmare
