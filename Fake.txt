Verse 1:
D                C9                  G      C9
I wake up in the morning, feeling so fake
My appearance hides the pain, that's hard to shake
I try to be someone else, just to fit in
But inside, I'm losing, and I can't win

Chorus:
Am7          C9           G
What's real? What's fake? I can't tell anymore
The narrative in my head, it's such a chore
Delusion's taking over, can't escape its grasp
But I'll fight to see reality at last

Verse 2:
I'm tired of living in a world of lies
Where appearances are everything, and truth hides
I want to break free, from this facade I've made
And be awake, from this masquerade

Chorus:
D
Am7          C             D
What's real? What's fake? I can't tell anymore
The narrative in my head, it's such a chore
Delusion's taking over, can't escape its grasp
But I'll fight to see reality at last

Bridge:
D           C9           G             C9
I'm done pretending, I'm done with the show
I'm tearing down the walls, and letting it all go
The truth will set me free, and make me whole
No more hiding behind a false role

Chorus:
What's real? What's fake? I can finally see
The narrative in my head, no longer controlling me
I've broken free from delusion's grasp
And embraced reality at last.
