capo 3rd fret

Verse 1:
In the darkness, I'm lost and alone
Trapped in a plight that's all my own
The world outside is just a shadow
Of the life I used to know

Chorus:
Em7                      G
But I won't shut down, I won't give up
Dsus4                          Asus4
I'll cut through the darkness, like a sharp blade's thrust
I won't let the blunt edges of my tired mind
Keep me from the light, that I need to find

Verse 2:
The world can be cruel, it can be unkind
Leaving us lost, and hard to find
But in the darkness, I'll make my stand
And I'll hold on, with a firm hand

Chorus:
But I won't shut down, I won't give up
I'll cut through the darkness, like a sharp blade's thrust
I won't let the blunt edges of my tired mind
Keep me from the light, that I need to find

Bridge:
For every shadow, there's a light
That can guide us through the darkest night
And though it may be hard to see
It's there for us, to set us free

Chorus:
But I won't shut down, I won't give up
I'll cut through the darkness, like a sharp blade's thrust
I won't let the blunt edges of my tired mind
Keep me from the light, that I need to find

Outro:
So let's hold on, and stay strong
And cut through the darkness, where we belong
For the light is there, if we only look
And we'll find our way, like an open book.
