I don't know what to do, I'm lost without a clue

Wherever you are, my heart is there with you
I'm watching you from afar, hoping you'll feel it too

But one thing's for sure, wherever you are, I'm watching you instead

Chorus:
I can feel you near, even though you're far away
I'm reaching out, hoping you'll hear what I have to say
It's complicated, but I won't give up the fight
